# Adams Crypto Bot

This project is a **crypto arbitrage bot** designed to identify and execute profitable price discrepancies across different cryptocurrency exchanges. It is intended as a starting point for building your own automated trading system. The repository contains:

- A simple Node.js script (`index.js`) that polls two exchanges (Binance and Coinbase) for the price of Bitcoin and calculates the difference between them. If a spread above a configurable threshold is detected, the bot reports a potential arbitrage opportunity. Actual trade execution logic is left as a placeholder for you to implement.
- A `package.json` file to manage dependencies and scripts.
- A sample `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files such as `node_modules` and environment configuration.
- A placeholder Solidity contract (`contracts/Arbitrage.sol`) demonstrating how one might wrap arbitrage logic into a smart contract on Ethereum.

## Disclaimer

This code is for **educational purposes only**. Trading cryptocurrencies involves significant risk, and automated trading amplifies those risks. You are responsible for thoroughly testing and auditing any logic before using real funds. Never expose your API keys or private keys in code or commit them to version control.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Adams-crypto-bot.git
   cd Adams-crypto-bot
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example` to store your API keys and other sensitive information. The example file is provided as a template and should *never* be committed with real keys.

3. **Run the bot**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The bot will begin polling the exchanges every minute. When it detects an arbitrage opportunity, it will log the details to the console. You can modify the polling frequency, add more exchanges, or implement trading logic in `index.js`.

## Smart Contract (Optional)

The `contracts/Arbitrage.sol` file is a placeholder for a Solidity contract that could be used to facilitate on-chain arbitrage (e.g., across decentralized exchanges). If you choose to build a smart contract component, make sure to research flash loans, gas costs, and smart contract security best practices.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the bot or adding support for more exchanges or assets, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
